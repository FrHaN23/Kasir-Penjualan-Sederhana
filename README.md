This app is build using VB.NET and Microsoft Access, and using my free time to build this kind of App in hope this will help you (and me in case i forget).

if you want to test this app try using:

username: inem

password: inem

and don't forget to put the database file in the bin/debug for debugging.
because i use Bcrypt to encrypt the password, so you can't add manually the user on database
and you need install Bcrypt package: 
https://github.com/BcryptNet/bcrypt.net
or using NuGet
